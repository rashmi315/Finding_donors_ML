# Finding_donors_ML
I have implemented supervised algorithm to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census which is further optimized. The goal is implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, infer this value from other publically available features.
